## Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on global terrorism data. The objective of this project is to analyze terrorism incidents around the world, understand their patterns, and visualize the insights gained.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), which includes information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 to 2019.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mitul2003/EDA_ON_GLOBAL_TERRORISM_DATA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd EDA_ON_GLOBAL_TERRORISM_DATA
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip installpip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib 
    ```

- **GTD_REPORT.pdf**: Detailed report on the findings from the EDA.
- **GTD_PRESENTATION.pdf**: PDF version of the presentation slides.
- **GTD_PRESENTATION.pptx**: PowerPoint presentation slides.
- **Globle_Terrorism_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the EDA code.
- **Globle_Terrorism_EDA.pdf**: PDF version of the EDA notebook.

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the Jupyter notebook `Globle_Terrorism_EDA.ipynb` and execute the cells. This will generate various plots and visualizations that help in understanding the global terrorism data.

## Results
The results of the analysis are documented in the `GTD_REPORT.pdf` and the `Globle_Terrorism_EDA.ipynb`. Key findings include:

- Trends in terrorist activities over the years.
- Geographical distribution of attacks.
- Common tactics and weapons used.
- Analysis of the most affected countries and regions.
